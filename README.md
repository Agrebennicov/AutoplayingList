# AutoplayingList
Try out to mimic social network's feed list with autoplaying videos

All insteresting things are in the `Autoplayinglist` module.
It consists of:
* Adapter itself
* AutoPlayingViewModel - an interface for your data class to implement
* AutoPlayingViewHolderManager
* AutoPlayingViewHolder
* Scroll listener

After I improve the caching and buffering + add delay before playback starts for smoother scrolling + cover with tests maybe it will evolve in standalone library :D

In conclusion it looks something like this ↓ 
P.S. sorry for not the best thumb images, working with what I've got ◕‿↼
